This code defines an Express.js route handler for user registration and login, using several libraries to validate input, hash passwords, and manage authentication. Here's a summary of each library and its purpose:

1. express
Purpose: Used to create an Express.js server and handle HTTP requests and responses.
Usage:
The express.Router() is used to define route handlers for /register and /login endpoints.
The router.post() method is used to handle POST requests for both registration and login.
2. Joi
Purpose: A library for input validation to ensure that incoming request data meets certain conditions.
Usage:
The registerSchema and loginSchema are used to validate the request body for user registration and login.
It checks if the data is of the correct type, format, and length (e.g., email format, password length, etc.).
3. sendResponse (Custom Helper)
Purpose: A custom helper function to send standardized responses to the client.
Usage:
This helper is used to send the appropriate HTTP response with a status code, data, and a message.
It handles both success and error responses for user registration and login.
4. User (Mongoose Model)
Purpose: Represents the user model in the database (MongoDB), defined using Mongoose.
Usage:
Used to interact with the MongoDB database (e.g., User.findOne() to check if a user exists).
New users are created and saved using the new User() constructor and newUser.save() method.
5. bcrypt
Purpose: A library for hashing and comparing passwords securely.
Usage:
During registration, the user's password is hashed using bcrypt.hash() before saving it to the database.
During login, the hashed password is compared with the stored hash using bcrypt.compare() to validate the user's credentials.
6. jsonwebtoken (JWT)
Purpose: A library for creating JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
Usage:
In the login route, a JWT token is created using jwt.sign() to authenticate the user. This token is returned to the client so they can use it for future requests.
7. dotenv
Purpose: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
Usage:
The dotenv/config import loads environment variables from a .env file, making process.env.AUTH_SECRET available for use in creating the JWT token.
Flow of the Code:
Registration (/register POST route):

The request body is validated using Joi (registerSchema).
It checks if the user already exists in the database (User.findOne()).
The password is hashed using bcrypt.hash().
The user is saved to the database (new User().save()).
A success response is sent back with the newly created user details.
Login (/login POST route):

The request body is validated using Joi (loginSchema).
The system checks if the user exists in the database (User.findOne()).
The password is verified using bcrypt.compare().
If the credentials are valid, a JWT token is generated and sent in the response along with user data.
In summary:

Express for routing.
Joi for input validation.
Mongoose for MongoDB interaction (via the User model).
bcrypt for password hashing and comparison.
jsonwebtoken (JWT) for token-based authentication.
dotenv for environment variable management.
